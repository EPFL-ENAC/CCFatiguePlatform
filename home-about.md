## Introduction:

CCFatigue is an initiative from the Composite Construction Laboratory (CCLab) that aims at facilitating access to and analysis of composite materials testings. It is comprised of a database environment allowing for organized storage and retrieval of new and already existing data. Additionally to the database, an analysis tool is made available to allow for computation, visualization and comparison of experimental data.

## Web database for composite materials testings:

Additionally to the analysis tool, the CCFatigue Web App includes a database environment that allows storage and management of raw data files. The database environment allows easy navigation and visualization of existing data and provides an intuitive environment for storage of composite materials testings. The database offers access to:

- Complete experimental setup of experiments
- Raw experimental data files
- Test configuration
- Graphs detailing the fatigue life of experiment

## Web based analysis tool for composite materials:

The CCFatigue Web App allows for quick and precise analysis of fatigue, fracture and quasi-static composite material testings. The analysis tool includes complete fatigue life analysis for single testings as well as a comparative analysis app to compare results over one or several experiments or testings. The analysis tool has two distinct applications, the first one being the analysis of the complete fatigue life of single samples with the possibility of viewing results such as the evolution of Stiffness, Hysteresis Area, Creep as well as the value for total dissipated energy (TDE).

Additionally, our analysis tool allows for visualization of results over a complete experiment with modules allowing computations such as Cycle Counting, drawing S-N curves, computing CLD, Fatigue Failure criterion as well as damage summation.
