# TST Standard Data format

### Structure

Each experiment is composed of several tests.
```
└───Experiment folder
	   │   Metadata file .xls
	   │   Test data 001 .csv
	   │   Test data 002 .csv
	   │   ...

```


### Directory/file naming conventions

* Experiment folder:  **TST _ {Researcher's lastname}_{Date} _ {Test type}** 
* Metadata file: **TST_{Date} _ {Test type}_metadata.xls** 
* Test data: **TST _ {Date} _ {Test type} _ {###}.csv** 

with:

* date: YYYY-MM (starting month of the experiment)
* Test type: {FA} = standard fatigue or {QS} = standard quasi-static or {TM}= DMA or temperature 
* \###: Specimen number

Mandatory data columns

* T--#
* Storage_modulus or Tan_delta or Machine_Load or MD_Load--#
