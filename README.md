# CCFatigue Platform

CCFatigue platform is an initiative from CCLab that aims at facilitating manipulation and storage of new and pre-existing data. It is composed of two main sections, the database is where all the data is stored, whereas the modules section is used for manipulating data.

# Standard data format
- Directories structures
- Filenaming conventions

# Contents

### Standardizing data
Use notebook Standarsizing_data.ipynb to convert data from ... to standard format


###Â Plotting
Use the notebook Plotting.ipynb to create plots using the outputs of various modules or raw data

### Modules
Using the notebooks in the modules folder, one can compute the right parameters for plotting i.e. the notebook 'Hysteresis loops.ipynb' uses stress/strain info to compute the TDE and evolution of stiffness
